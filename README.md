This is a web app built for managing invoices of a company. It can create, delete, store and print invoices, I've also added an authentication system. I'm still working on it to add more features. I've used ReactJS, Redux, Moment.js and Material-ui. 
Since I'm still adding features, I didn't wanted to host it now, but you can find a screenshot below.
